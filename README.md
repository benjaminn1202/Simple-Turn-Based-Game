# Simple Turn-Based Game
A simple turn-based game written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You play as Benjamin, a brawler and you fight a giant rat controlled by the computer. The enemy always chooses their best move from their skillset. I created this project to explore objects and DOM manipulation.
